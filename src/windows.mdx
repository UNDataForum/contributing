# Developing on Windows

Developing on Windows 10 is fully supported with [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).  As a prerequisite, you need to ensure that you have local admin privileges.

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is Microsoft's attempt to relieve the pains that developers working with a non-Microsoft on Windows had for many nears. WSL basically gives a Linux development experience to Windows users.

Your starting point is the [WSL Windows 10 Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) in which you find instructions how to check if your Windows 10 is compatible. If you have access to the Microsoft Store, you can install Ubuntu 18.04 straight from the store.

If you do not have access to the Microsoft Store, you need to follow [Manually download WSL distro packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) to download Ubuntu 18.04. When the download is complete, you need to continue with [Windows Server Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server). Finally, you need to setup WSL as explained in [Initializing a newly installed distro](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/initialize-distro).

If at any point you have to roll back your WSL installation, it is not enough to delete the folder that contains the installation. Check for installed WSL distributions by running

```powershell
wslconfig.exe /list
```

Pick your distirubtion, e.g. `Ubuntu-18.04`. Run

```powershell
wslconfig.exe /u Ubuntu-18.04
```

to unregister. Now you can delete the folder containing the WSL distribution and start over.

**At this point you have a Ubuntu 18.04 installation that you can access via the WSL terminal, but which is otherwise isolated from Windows 10.**

## Tooling

Now you can follow the steps in [Developing on Linux](/linux) to install all required tooling in your WSL Ubuntu 18.04.

## VSCode

All tooling runs in WSL, except you editor, which runs on Windows. Therefore, go ahead and install the windows version fo [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your Windows 10. Before you continue with [VSCode Configuration](/vscode), we need to integrate WSL into VSCode. Some tutorials suggest that it is necessary to install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to make Git work with VSCode in a WSL scenario. This is not necessary. We have Git already installed via WSL and all we need to is enable VSCode to use it.

Download [WSLGit](https://github.com/andy-5/wslgit) and add this entry to VSCode's `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "git.path": "C:\\PATH\\TO\\wslgit.exe"
}
```

## Choosing the right working directory

Your Windows home directory is `%USERPROFILE%`, which normally corresponds to `C:\\Users\\<username>`. In Linux your home directory is `/home/<username>`. Your WSL home directory and Windows home directory are not the same. This is crucial when cloning a repository with Git. If you just clone into `/home/<username>`, VSCode cannot access your project. This why WSL mounts all Windows system drives. `%USERPROFILE%` corresponds to `/mnt/c/Users/<username>`. If you clone in this directory (or better a subdirectory), VSCode can access your project.
